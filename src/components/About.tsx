              Hi, again! I&apos;m Monique. I&apos;m a frontend developer with a
              passion for blending creativity with functionality. I enjoy
              building websites that are both beautiful and user-friendly. I
              believe in simplicity and minimalism and enjoy bringing that ethos
              into every project I touch.
            </p>

            <p className="paragraph mt-8">
              I&apos;m a lifelong learner and I&apos;m always looking for new
              ways to grow and improve my skills. I&apos;m currently learning
              Vue and I&apos;m excited to see where it takes me.
            </p>

            <p className="paragraph mt-8">
              If you can&apos;t tell by now, I&apos;m an avid reader. So when
              I&apos;m not coding, you can find me with my nose in a book.
              Either that or I&apos;m rewatching my favourite shows for the
              100th time.
